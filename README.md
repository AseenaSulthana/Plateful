- Donation Tracking 📈: Tracks statuses (listed, claimed, picked up, delivered) with real-time dashboards for users 📋.
- Feedback System ⭐: NGOs rate and comment on donations, helping restaurants improve 📝.
- Search and Filters 🔍: NGOs filter donations by type, quantity, or pickup time; restaurants view donation history.
- Security 🔒: Implements HTTPS, input validation, and JWT authentication for data protection.
- Mobile Responsiveness 📱: Accessible on desktops, tablets, and mobiles, with potential for a mobile app.
- Analytics and Reporting 📊: Tracks metrics (e.g., food donated, NGOs served) for admins or public transparency.
